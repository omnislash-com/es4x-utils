# Introduction
This library offers some basic helper classes for the [ES4X Runtime](https://github.com/reactiverse/es4x).

It contains 3 different modules:
- **utils**: basic helpers to manipulate Javascript objects, arrays, string, dates or math.
- **network**: classes to manage the incoming query, and to do queries.
- **jsonprocessor**: these classes offer methods to do operations (filtering, maths...) on JSON objects.
